# Using Query Params and multiple html & js files

We have our backend of our articles and authors.






If we want to start with our authors, then I want to be able to click on an author's name to get to it's show page.





How do we do this?





Then, what if we want to see all the articles and more importantly, create a new article that belongs to an *existing* author and *existing* magazine.




If this is on the articles page:

- we will fetch the articles as well as all the authors and all the magazines.
- We want to make a form that will allow us to create a new article.
- How can I dynamically create a dropdown for the user to select the author and the magazine?
- Great! Now how do I use this information to create a new article with established relationships?
